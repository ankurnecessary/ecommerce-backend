# Here the instructions define your application as a service called "server".
# This service is built from the Dockerfile in the current directory.
# You can add other services your application may depend on here, such as a
# database or a cache. For examples, see the Awesome Compose repository:
# https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose
services:
  # Dev server - http://localhost:${PORT}
  server:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev
    container_name: ecommerce-backend-server
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: ${NODE_ENV} # ${NODE_ENV} is from .env file
    ports:
      - ${PORT}:${PORT}
    volumes:
